# Radar-System-Aurdino-UNO-

Radar System with Arduino and Processing

This repository contains a radar system implementation using:

Arduino Sketch: Captures radar sensor data and transmits it via serial communication.

Processing Application: Visualizes radar data in real-time using a .pde file.

How to Use
Upload the arduino_code.ino to your Arduino board.
Run the radar_code_for_processing_app.pde in the Processing IDE.
Connect the radar sensor and observe real-time data visualization.

Requirements
Hardware: Arduino board, radar sensor module.
Software: Arduino IDE, Processing IDE.
